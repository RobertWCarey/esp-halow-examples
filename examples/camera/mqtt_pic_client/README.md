# ESP MQTT Picture Client

This example is very similar to `http_pic_server` but instead send the image to an MQTT topic. It is
written in a way that makes it fairly straight forward to integrate with the Home Assistant
[MQTT Camera Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/camera.mqtt/).
